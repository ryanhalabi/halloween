We are pleased to extend you an offer of employment as a Junior Developer at PriorMalady, a company making a difference in the field of post mortem analytics.  Everyone here is excited for you to join us on your first day, this Saturday, October 26th.  We know with your wealth of experience there’s no limit to the impact you will make.

Just a few housekeeping issues.  We’ll be welcoming you and a few other incoming employees with a Halloween party!  How fun is that?!?!  As such you’ll be expected to 
- Arrive in a costume
- Contribute a dish/drink or cash for pizza (times are tough)
- Pencil and paper to take notes
- Be ready to party!


Don’t think the first day is going to be all fun and games though.  A security auditor will be present investigating some technical anomalies we are currently experiencing and will require your assistance.  Don’t worry, I’m sure there will be plenty of time for you to relax in between any work you get assigned.

Once again, we can’t wait for you to join us.

Best,
PriorMalady HR



Translation:  I’m hosting a halloween party 10/26 at 7 PM and you’re invited, there will be food and booze.  

The main event of the night will be a puzzle adventure I will be putting together.  The adventure won’t take the whole time, there will still be plenty of time to hang out and relax.

You can bring a +1.  I hope you can make it!
